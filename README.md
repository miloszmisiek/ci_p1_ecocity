# User Experience
## Wireframes
[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create wireframes as part of project planning. They were used to discuss concept of the website with designated Code Institute mentor. Final project differs in some places from original concept presented below to improve UX or responsivnes of the site.

## Layout Design

### Fonts
Two styles of fonts are used for the project: 'Teko' for headings and 'Montserrat' for body text elements. All fonts are backed-up with sans-serif.

### Colour
The dominant colour is shade of blue with white background. Most images were chosen to contrast with chosen scheme. Blue is colour of earth's oceans and the website was created to get users attention on earth's climate change problem.

# Features

  - Heading is question the user may encounter with waste recycling.
  - The purpose of this section is to get user familiar with classes of waste and how to segrate them for recycling in every day life. It is structured in the way that top part gives user information on what is classified under the waste class, but bottom part represensts what should not be put together with the segregated waste of class.
  - Intention is to reflect user on better home waste handling to reduce waste pollution.
  - It was decided to build this section using html elements with cascade styling instead of pre-made up image to allow for responsivness.

# Technologies Used
- HTML5 - basic site structure.
- CSS - cascade styling for website.
- Balsamiq - wireframes used at planning stage.
- Gitpod - cloud development platform to deploy website.
- Github - code hosting platform to host the website.

# Testing
All various test results are presented in separate [TESTING](TESTING.md) file.

# Deployment

The website was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps are as follows:
1. In GitHub project repository click on **Settings** tab.

![GitHub Repository](assets/images/readme/github-deployment-1.png)

2. On the left side, find **Pages** tab.
3. On the right side of navigation table, find **Source** section and select *main* in the *branch* tab, make sure *root* directory is selected and press **Save**.
4. If steps were succesfully followed, the green box will appear with message that the site was deployed.

    *Until the site is published and ready to view it can take several minutes for server to response.*
